                From the Dimension of the Dreams (Hanafall) Maxwell is famous for being the rich prince of the royalty Romali. The origins of his success came from the traditional factories of copper and hydrographic industry around the lands, since the entire Hanafall is known for carrying the curse of lack of water in their soil. With that in mind Maxwells and his family really took the business as an opportunity to make him what he is today, rich and known for everyone. It might sound amazing at first but few ones actually know his ego more closely, which definitely isn't small.
